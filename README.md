# OPC Server with Web-Based SCADA HMI

This project implements an OPC UA server that simulates a life sciences process and provides a web-based SCADA HMI to visualize real-time process data.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `pip` for installing Python packages
- An OPC client like [UaExpert](https://www.unified-automation.com/products/development-tools/uaexpert.html) or [Kepware](https://www.kepware.com/en-us/products/kepserverex/) for testing

## Clone and Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name

Install Dependencies

    Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

    bash

python -m venv opc_scada_venv
source opc_scada_venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `opc_scada_venv\Scripts\activate`

Install the required Python packages:

bash

    pip install flask opcua

Running the OPC Server

    Navigate to the directory where your OPC server script is located (e.g., server.py), and run the server:

    bash

python server.py

You should see a message indicating that the OPC UA server has started:

arduino

    OPC UA Server started at opc.tcp://localhost:4840

Running the Web-Based SCADA UI

    In a new terminal (with the virtual environment activated), navigate to the directory where your Flask app script is located (e.g., app.py), and run the Flask application:

    bash

python app.py

You should see a message indicating that the server is running:

csharp

    * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)

    Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to access the SCADA HMI.

Validating Data Consistency with OPC Client

    Using UaExpert:
        Download and install UaExpert.
        Open UaExpert and create a new connection using the endpoint opc.tcp://localhost:4840.
        Once connected, browse the data model to find the variables for temperature, pressure, and humidity.
        Compare the values displayed in UaExpert with those shown in your SCADA UI.
