# OPC Server with Web-Based SCADA HMI

This project implements an OPC server simulating a life sciences process and provides a web-based SCADA Human-Machine Interface (HMI) for real-time data visualization. The system utilizes Flask for the backend, PostgreSQL for optional data storage, and UaExpert as the OPC client for validation.
